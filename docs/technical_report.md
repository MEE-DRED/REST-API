## 3. Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis

### 3.1 Implementation Overview
The project implements two search algorithms to demonstrate efficiency differences:

1. **Linear Search**: Sequential scanning through transaction list
2. **Dictionary Lookup**: Hash-based direct access using transaction ID as key

### 3.2 Algorithm Implementations

#### 3.2.1 Linear Search Algorithm
```python
def linear_search(self, transaction_id: int) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Linear search through the list to find transaction by ID.
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    """
    for transaction in self.transactions_list:
        if transaction['id'] == transaction_id:
            return transaction
    return None
```

#### 3.2.2 Dictionary Lookup Algorithm
```python
def dictionary_lookup(self, transaction_id: int) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Dictionary lookup to find transaction by ID.
    Time Complexity: O(1) average case
    """
    return self.transactions_dict.get(transaction_id)
```

### 3.3 Performance Comparison Results

**Test Configuration**:
- Dataset: 20 SMS transactions
- Search Operations: 100 iterations Ã— 20 searches = 2,000 total operations
- Test Environment: Local development machine

**Results**:
| Metric | Linear Search | Dictionary Lookup | Improvement Factor |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Execution Time | 0.002156 seconds | 0.000043 seconds | 50.1x faster |
| Average Time per Search | 0.000001078 seconds | 0.0000000215 seconds | - |
| Time Complexity | O(n) | O(1) | - |

**Analysis**:
The dictionary lookup method demonstrated significant performance advantages:
- **50x faster execution** for the test dataset
- Performance improvement scales with dataset size
- Dictionary lookup maintains constant time regardless of data position
- Linear search performance degrades as dataset grows

### 3.4 Memory vs. Speed Trade-off

**Dictionary Approach**:
- **Advantages**: O(1) search time, excellent for frequent lookups
- **Disadvantages**: Additional memory overhead for hash table
- **Best Use Case**: Applications with frequent search operations

**Linear Search Approach**:
- **Advantages**: No additional memory overhead, simple implementation
- **Disadvantages**: O(n) search time, inefficient for large datasets
- **Best Use Case**: Small datasets or infrequent search operations

### 3.5 Alternative Data Structures

**Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Maintains sorted order
- Good balance between memory and performance
- Suitable for range queries

**Hash Set**:
- Time Complexity: O(1) for existence checks
- Memory efficient for simple lookups
- Cannot store additional data per key

**B-Tree**:
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Optimized for disk storage systems
- Excellent for database indexing
- Handles large datasets efficiently

### 3.6 Practical Applications in Mobile Money Systems

**Real-world Scenarios**:
1. **User Authentication**: Dictionary lookup for user credentials
2. **Transaction Validation**: Quick verification of transaction references
3. **Fraud Detection**: Fast lookup of suspicious account patterns
4. **Balance Inquiries**: Instant account balance retrieval

---

## 4. Basic Authentication Analysis and Limitations

### 4.1 Basic Authentication Implementation
The API implements HTTP Basic Authentication where credentials are base64-encoded and sent in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>
```

**Valid Credentials**:
- admin:password123
- user:user123
- demo:demo123

### 4.2 Security Vulnerabilities

#### 4.2.1 Encoding vs. Encryption
**Issue**: Base64 encoding is not encryption
- Credentials are easily decoded by anyone intercepting the request
- Example: `YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=` decodes to `admin:password123`

**Impact**: Complete credential exposure in network traffic

#### 4.2.2 Credentials in Every Request
**Issue**: No session management or token system
- Username and password sent with every API call
- Increases exposure window for credential interception
- No way to revoke access without changing passwords

**Impact**: Higher risk of credential compromise

#### 4.2.3 No Token Expiration
**Issue**: Credentials remain valid indefinitely
- No automatic expiration or refresh mechanism
- Compromised credentials remain valid until manually changed
- No way to implement temporary access

**Impact**: Extended window of vulnerability

#### 4.2.4 Replay Attack Vulnerability
**Issue**: No request uniqueness or timestamps
- Intercepted requests can be replayed exactly
- No protection against man-in-the-middle attacks
- No request signing or integrity verification

**Impact**: Potential for unauthorized transaction manipulation

#### 4.2.5 No Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
- Unlimited authentication attempts allowed
- No account lockout mechanisms
- No monitoring of failed login attempts

**Impact**: Vulnerability to credential guessing attacks

### 4.3 Recommended Security Improvements

#### 4.3.1 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
**Advantages**:
- Stateless authentication with digital signatures
- Token expiration and refresh capabilities
- Can include user claims and permissions
- Industry standard with broad support

**Implementation Example**:
```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def generate_jwt_token(user_id: str) -> str:
    payload = {
        'user_id': user_id,
        'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1),
        'iat': datetime.utcnow()
    }
    return jwt.encode(payload, SECRET_KEY, algorithm='HS256')
```

#### 4.3.2 OAuth 2.0
**Advantages**:
- Industry standard for authorization
- Delegated access without password sharing
- Refresh token support for long-term access
- Granular scope control

**Flow Example**:
1. Client redirects to authorization server
2. User authenticates and grants permission
3. Authorization server returns access token
4. Client uses token for API access

#### 4.3.3 API Key Authentication
**Advantages**:
- Simple implementation
- Easy to generate and revoke
- Can include rate limiting per key
- Suitable for server-to-server communication

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Store API keys securely (hashed)
- Include key metadata (creation date, permissions)
- Implement key rotation policies

#### 4.3.4 Additional Security Measures

**HTTPS/TLS Encryption**:
- Encrypt all communication in transit
- Prevent credential interception
- Required for any production deployment

**Rate Limiting**:
```python
from collections import defaultdict
import time

class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests=100, window_seconds=3600):
        self.max_requests = max_requests
        self.window_seconds = window_seconds
        self.requests = defaultdict(list)
    
    def is_allowed(self, client_id: str) -> bool:
        now = time.time()
        window_start = now - self.window_seconds
        
        # Clean old requests
        self.requests[client_id] = [
            req_time for req_time in self.requests[client_id]
            if req_time > window_start
        ]
        
        # Check if under limit
        if len(self.requests[client_id]) < self.max_requests:
            self.requests[client_id].append(now)
            return True
        return False
```

**Input Validation and Sanitization**:
- Validate all input parameters
- Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations

**Comprehensive Logging**:
- Log all authentication attempts
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Include request timestamps and IP addresses
- Implement alerting for security events
